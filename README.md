## Electric Vehicle EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on electric vehicles. The primary goal was to explore and visualize key patterns and trends within the dataset, shedding light on various aspects of the electric vehicle market.

**Project Overview**

**Objective**

The objective of this project was to conduct an exploratory analysis of electric vehicle data. The aim was to uncover insights into the distribution of electric vehicles, their specifications, and trends in adoption. This analysis is intended to provide a deeper understanding of the electric vehicle landscape and support further research or decision-making in this area.

**Problem Statement**

The dataset contained raw and unstructured data that required extensive cleaning and transformation to ensure meaningful analysis. The main challenges included handling missing data, visualizing complex relationships, and making the data interpretable for analysis. The goal was to address these challenges through effective data preprocessing and visualization techniques.

**Solution**

To overcome these challenges, the following steps were taken:

**Data Cleaning:**

1. Handled missing values by identifying and imputing or removing incomplete data entries.

2. Checked and corrected data types to ensure compatibility with analysis tools.

3. Renamed columns and restructured the dataset for better readability and analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

**Distribution Analysis:** Plotted histograms and distribution plots to visualize the spread of key variables such as vehicle range, battery capacity, and price.

**Correlation Analysis:** Used scatter plots and heatmaps to explore relationships between different variables, such as the correlation between battery capacity and vehicle range.

**Trend Analysis:** Implemented line plots and bar charts to examine trends in electric vehicle adoption over time, such as the increase in available models and advancements in battery technology.

**Interactive Visualizations:** Leveraged Plotly to create interactive visualizations that allow for deeper exploration of the data, such as hover-over information for detailed insights.

**Tools Used**

**Python:** For data preprocessing, manipulation, and analysis.

**Pandas:** To clean and organize the dataset, handle missing values, and perform basic data transformations.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore data distributions and relationships.

**Plotly:** For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations that provide a more engaging exploration experience.

**Key Steps in the Analysis**

**1. Import Libraries and Load Dataset:** All necessary Python libraries were imported, and the dataset was loaded into the environment for analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, correcting data types, and renaming columns to improve readability.

**3. Data Exploration:**

**Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and distribution plots were created to explore the spread of key metrics, such as vehicle range and price.

**Correlation Analysis**: Scatter plots and heatmaps were used to identify and visualize relationships between different variables.

**Trend Analysis:** Line plots and bar charts were utilized to examine how electric vehicle characteristics and availability have changed over time.

**Interactive Visualizations:** Plotly was used to develop interactive plots that allow for more detailed exploration of the data.

**Conclusion**

This Electric Vehicle EDA project provided valuable insights into the electric vehicle market, uncovering trends, correlations, and distributions within the dataset. The use of both static and interactive visualizations made the data more accessible and interpretable, laying the groundwork for further analysis or business decisions related to electric vehicles.
